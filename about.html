    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p><strong>SmartUrbanity</strong> is a European innovation project funded under the DUT (Driving Urban Transitions) partnership. It seeks to design and test digital, participatory, and inclusive solutions for implementing the <em>15-minute city</em> concept in diverse urban environments.</p>

      <h3>Project Vision</h3>
      <p>The project envisions cities where all essential services — such as work, education, health, retail, and recreation — are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. SmartUrbanity promotes accessibility, proximity, and livability through a people-centered approach powered by technology and collaboration.</p>
