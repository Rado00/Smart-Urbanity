    <h2>Use Cases: Pilot Cities</h2>
    <p>The SmartUrbanity project implements and tests its solutions in five diverse urban contexts, each facing unique challenges in accessibility, urban mobility, and social inclusion.</p>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
      <p>Focus: Improving mixed urban mobility in peripheral neighborhoods. The pilot involves real-time mobility monitoring and strategies to enhance the 15-minute accessibility model in a complex, historic city layout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>Karlsruhe, Germany</h3>
      <p>Focus: Enhancing integration between public transport and active/shared mobility modes. The pilot tests multimodal hubs and participatory planning methods in mid-sized urban areas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>İzmir, Türkiye</h3>
      <p>Focus: Addressing challenges in multimodal transport in rapidly growing urban districts. Pilot activities promote inclusive mobility access, especially for women and low-income communities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>Lyon Metropolitan Area, France</h3>
      <p>Focus: Promoting last-mile connectivity and safety in peri-urban zones. The pilot uses gamification and citizen data to co-design solutions for equitable access to daily services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>Thurgau, Switzerland</h3>
      <p>Focus: Coordinating mobility services in rural and suburban settings. The pilot integrates demand-responsive transport and evaluates accessibility gaps through spatial analysis.</p>
